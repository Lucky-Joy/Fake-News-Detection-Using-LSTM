# ðŸ“° Fake News Detection Using LSTM

This project uses **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), to accurately detect and classify fake and real news articles based on their textual content.

---

## ðŸ“š Dataset

- **Source**: [Fake and Real News Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset)
- Contains labeled news articles with binary classification: `FAKE` or `REAL`
- Preprocessing includes:
  - Lowercasing
  - Removing punctuation and stopwords
  - Tokenization and padding for LSTM input

---

## ðŸ§  Model Architecture

- **LSTM-based neural network**
- Embedding layer for word vector representation
- One or more LSTM layers followed by dense layers
- Binary classification output (Real or Fake)

---

## ðŸ“Š Performance

- âœ… **Accuracy**: **97.9%**
- Model shows strong performance on both training and validation sets
- Can be extended to multi-class classification or real-time news feeds

---

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- Python 3.x  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)  
- Scikit-learn (for preprocessing & evaluation)
